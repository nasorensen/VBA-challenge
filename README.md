VBA Assignment
Note: I created this code with the aid of the Xpert Learning Assitant available through the UMN Data Bootcamp. I did have to modify the suggestions, so it is not an exact copy of their suggested code.
Note(2): I know my numbers for the quarterly change and therefore percent change are different than they are supposed to be, but I cannot for the life of me figure out the equation you used in order to get the numbers you did for Quarterly Change. As a result, my numbers are a bit off but I believe the actual code is still accurate.
